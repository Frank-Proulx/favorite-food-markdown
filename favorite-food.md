# How to make a delicious fritatta for two

One of the _best ways_ to eat breakfast is to cook a bunch of things together and then bake some eggs on top of them. You can begin preheating your oven to 400 degrees, now.

## First you cook the things

This involves various ingredients that will go in the pan and get the eggs poured onto them. These items are to be added to heated olive oil in the order below:

1. Peppers
2. Garlic
3. Corn
4. Soyrizo
5. Potatoes

## Now to prepare the eggs...

Add the following to a bowl in any order:

* Six cracked eggs
* Salt
* Pepper
* Italian herbs blend
* A little shredded cheese (to make them creamy)

## Last step before the oven

Pour the eggs onto the cooked items, add tomatoes if you'd like, and bake for about 10 minutes until the eggs are cooked and fluffy. Remove from oven, **enjoy!**
